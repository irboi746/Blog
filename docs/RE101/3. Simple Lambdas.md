## Track3_1
This sample aims to show what it looks like in assembly when variable is initialised as a pointer and as an actual value.

Additionally, it aims to show us how to manipulate types in IDA to make the output look like the source code that we are reversing.

### Track3_1.c
In track3_1, we are given the following C file, which contains 2 structs, `SimpleContext` and `SimpleLambda`. As can be seen below, `SimpleLambda` will be making use of the `SimpleContext` and in the main function, we will simply be passing values into the 
```C++
struct SimpleContext{
   int Arg1;
   int Arg2;
};
struct SimpleLambda{
   void *pCallback;
   short Priority;
   struct SimpleContext *pContext
};
int main(){
   struct SimpleContext c;
   c.Arg1 = 10;
   c.Arg2 = 12;
   struct SimpleLambda l;
   l.priority =1;
}
```

### Track3_1.exe
In the case of `Track3_1.exe`, the `.pdb` file exists, and hence we can find the structure of SimpleContext and SimpleLambda in local types (`Shift` + `F1`). 
![[Pasted image 20230224092635.png]]
However, at this stage, looking at the disassembly below, 
![[Pasted image 20230224092844.png]]
We simply just need to go to the "local types" window select the types we want, in this case `SimpleContext` and `SimpleLambda` then hit `enter` to import the structures.
![[Pasted image 20230224092923.png]]
And as can be seen below, the structs have been imported to our `structure` window.
![[Pasted image 20230224093110.png]]
We then go to the stack where the variables are stored (double-click on the variable) and then `alt`+`q` to convert the variables to the structure we want it to be.
![[Pasted image 20230224110221.png]]
As can be seen below, `Arg1` and `Arg2` is labeled on the disassembler view.
![[Pasted image 20230224110345.png]]
We also notice an interesting phenomena, where for `Priority` variable, we see the following instructions:
```
mov eax,1
mov [rbp+120h+var_F0], ax
```

For this we will need to reference [[#Track3_1.c]], we know that `Priority` variable is declared as a `short Priority` which is 16bit or 2 bytes. `EAX` is 4 bytes or 32bits, and in this case, the initial value of Priority is transmitted to the EAX register first before 2 bytes from EAX, AX is being copied to the stack.

### Quiz
> Q1. Please find the size of Arg1 field of SimpleContext Structure. How many bytes is it?

Ans : 4

>Q2. To initialize the Priority field of SimpleLambda structure the compiler firstly puts 1 in EAX general purpose register, but then takes only AX part of it. Why?

Ans : Priority field has short data type - two bytes long. The AX has the same length and compiler used this part of the register in instruction

>Q3. You could easily find the initial values for Arg1 and Arg2 on your program’s stack. Could you do the same for the initial value for Priority? 

Ans : Yes, the initial value for Priority 1 the compiler decided to transmit through the general purpose register, not the stack, but anyway the resulting local var is on a stack

## Track3_2
This track aims to show how it looks like in assembly when there is a function call in assembly and also that pointer can point to pointers and pointing can be nested.

### Track3_2.c
```C++
struct SimpleContext{
   int Arg1;
   int Arg2;
};
struct SimpleLambda{
   void *pCallback;
   short Priority;
   struct SimpleContext *pContext
};
int SimpleCallback(struct SimpleContext *Context){
   Context->Arg1 = 14;
   return 0;
}

int main(){
   struct SimpleContext c;
   c.Arg1 = 10;
   c.Arg2 = 12;
   struct SimpleLambda l;
   l.pCallback = simpleCallback;
   l.priority =1;
   l.pContext = &c;
}
```

### Track3_2.exe
We have the following assembly.
![[Pasted image 20230227000921.png]]
We follow what we did for the first binary, where we import local types `SimpleContext` and `SimpleLambda`. However, this time we will attempt to utilise the local type `SimpleLambda`. To do so, we will need to identify `Priority` variable as we already did above, and follow it in the stack.
![[Pasted image 20230227004317.png]]
As can be seen above, the stack structure closely resembles that of the one in `SimpleLambda`. (We can refer to our source code too).
![[Pasted image 20230227004426.png]]
Therefore, we can guess that `var_F8` is likely the pointer to `callback` variable. As such, we can apply the structure starting from `var_F8`.
![[Pasted image 20230227014945.png]]
Shown above is the disassembly after all the renaming and we can see above that after adding all the structures, and renaming, the disassembly is resembles the actual code.

### Quiz
>Q1.  Find the real start address of SimpleCallback function in track3_2.exe. Type your answer in the 0xXXXXXXXXX format without the initial zeros.

![[Pasted image 20230227021037.png]]
Ans : 0x140011770

>Q2.  Which fields of SimpleLambda structure are pointers?

Ans : `pCallback` and `pContext` fields are pointers, they contain addresses

>Q3. The pContext field in SimpleLambda structure is the pointer to SimpleContext custom data type. Could SimpleContext in its turn contain some fields with pointers? 

Ans : Yes, sure, C allows pointers to pointers to pointers and so on, it’s not a problem

## Track3_3
Track3_3 attempts to show us the difference in disassembly when "shallow copying" is done vs "deep copying". Shallow copying is seen where variable `l` is directly assigned to variable `l2`  and deep copying is seen in the later part of the code where `memcpy()` is used to copy the value of `l` to `l2`.

In the case of shallow copying, we see that what was copied was simply the address/pointers of the values(values in `l2` are simply pointed from `l`) which might not be ideal whereas for "deep copying" the address/pointers are not copied but instead different from each other. The values are stored in different addresses, even though they are the same value.

### Track3_3.c
```C++
struct SimpleContext{
   int Arg1;
   int Arg2;
};
struct SimpleLambda{
   void *pCallback;
   short Priority;
   struct SimpleContext *pContext
};

int SimpleCallback(struct SimpleContext *Context){
   Context->Arg1 = 14;
   return 0;
}

int main(){
   struct SimpleContext c;
   c.Arg1 = 10;
   c.Arg2 = 12;
   struct SimpleLambda l;

   l.pCallback = SimpleCallback;
   l.Priority = 1;
   l.pContext = &c;
   struct SimpleLambda l2 = l;

   printf("new lambda priority val: %d and address: 0x%x\n", l2.Priority, &l2.priority);
   printf("old lambda priority val: %d and address: 0x%x\n", l.Priority, &l.priority);

   printf("new lambda context address: 0x%x\n", l2.pContext);
   printf("old lambda context address: 0x%x\n", l.pContext);

   l2.pContext = malloc(sizeof(struct SimpleContext));
   memcpy(l2.pContext,l.pContext,sizeof(struct SimpleContext));
   
   printf("new lambda context address: 0x%x\n", l2.pContext);
   printf("old lambda context address: 0x%x\n", l.pContext);
   printf("new lambda context arg1: %d\n", l2.pContext->Arg1);
}
```

### Track3_3.exe
Below is the function renamed initially, with the knowledge we gained till track3_2.
**Shallow Copy**
![[Pasted image 20230227021742.png]]![[Pasted image 20230227021835.png]]

As can be seen before `rep movsb`, the function looks exactly, like what is happening at the source code. Another thing we can notice here, when renaming are instructions : 
```
mov rdi, rax
mov rsi, rcx
rep movsb
```
Where, `rdi` is the destination index and `rsi`, source index. Before `rep movsb` which means copying of bytes repeatedly from source to destination is executed.

We trace the register `rcx` since the value in it is moved into `rsi` and we see above that the address of `simpleLambda` is loaded into `rcx` which is then loaded into `rsi`. 

`rdi` is loaded from `rax` which is loaded from `var_F8` and `0x18` (hex) is moved into `ecx` before `rep movsb` is executed. From here it seems like `ecx` is being used as a counter. The above operation is the copying of values in `simpleLambda l` to `simpleLambda l2`. 

Therefore, we can deduce that `var_F8` is the address for the new lambda.

**Deep Copy**
In deep copy below,

The disassembly below is a nicer representation after the renaming and also going to the stack and giving `l2` the `simpleLambda` structure.

### Quiz
>Q1. Inside the binary find the copying of a SimpleLambda structure. How many bytes will be taken to the new structure? 

Ans : 24

>Q2. Would such a default way of C copying pose some possible problems to us? 

Ans : Yes, the value fields would be good, but all the pointer fields would still reference the same memory addresses. So in this case changing would affect both structures - original and copied one

>Q3. Please locate in the resulting executable the malloc() call you added for deep copying. How many bytes does it allocate for SimpleContext and why?

Ans : 8 bytes, you provided sizeof(struct SimpleContext) as argument and SimpleContext contains just 2 fields 4 bytes each
