# CSIT TISC 2022 (1)
## Level 1 : Slay The Dragon
The recently launched online RPG game "Slay The Dragon" has been hot topic in the online gaming community of late, due to a seemingly impossible final boss. Amongst the multiple tirades against the forementioned boss, much controversy has been brewing due to rumors of the game being a recruitment campaign for PALINDROME, the cybercriminal organisation responsible for recent cyberattacks on Singapore's critical infrastructure.

You are tasked to find a way to beat (hack) the game and provide us with the flag (a string in the format TISC{xxx}) that would be displayed after beating the final boss. Your success is critical to ensure the safety of Singapore's cyberspace, as it would allow us to send more undercover operatives to infiltrate PALINDROME.

To aid in your efforts, we have managed to obtain the source code of the game for you. We look forward to your success! 

### Recon
- In the initial stage of my recon, I will attempt to map out what the visible functions are by connecting directly and playing the game.

```
./client_linux_x64 --host chal00bq3ouweqtzva9xcobep6spl5m75fucey.ctf.sg --port 18261
```

#### Main Page
- From the Main Page Below, we can see that there is only 3 functions we can do : [[#Fight Boss]], [[#Mine Gold]] and [[#Go Shopping]].
- We can also see the Player stats from the Main Page.

#### Fight Boss
- So I shall attempt to fight the boss straight away and I realised that there is an impossible boss to beat "Dragon".

#### Mine Gold
- In the Mine Gold function I find out that after every "Mining" activity, the amount of Gold

#### Go Shopping
![[Pasted image 20220826222706.png]]

#### battleevent.py 

#### battleservice.py

#### command.py
![[Pasted image 20220829150803.png]]

#### workevent.py
![[Pasted image 20220826233015.png]]

### Exploitation
- Therefore from the above code, we can see that in battleservice.py has a function `__compute_battle_outcome()` which will iterate through the variable `command` and count the number of `BOSS_ATTACK`, `ATTACK` and `HEAL`. 
- From Line 28 of `battleservice.py` `self.history.log_commands_from_str(self.server.recv_command_str())` we know that the server receives the command sent by the client as string and these commands are interpreted in the file `command.py` which is within the `/src/core/models`
- Hence all that we need to do is to send 100 "ATTACK" strings in one `Command.ATTACK` and we will be able to beat the last boss - "Dragon". 
- This can be done by modifying the `ATTACK` variable in the `Command()` class like below.
 
![[Pasted image 20220829151730.png]]

- Next we will need to modify battleevent.py accordingly so that the number of "ATTACKs" done will be reflected on client side which will then be validated.

![[Pasted image 20220829152358.png]]

- Now we will proceed to fighting the last boss and as can be seen, because we overpowered the previous bosses, our health remains full.

![[Pasted image 20220829152500.png]]

- From below, we won the final boss and we got out flag!

## Level 2 : Leaky Matrices
Looks like PALINDROME implemented their own authentication protocol and cryptosystem to provide a secure handshake between any 2 services or devices. It does not look secure to us, can you take a look at what we have got?

### Understanding Protocol
- The three main takeaways are as below.

![[Pasted image 20220829153647.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220829153526.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220829153506.png]]

### Exploitation
- Hence the secret keys can be leaked in the "Challenge Me" phase, where we will have to reverse the `AND` operation first then reverse the matrix multiplication with the response and challenge to obtain the secret.

#### Leaking SECRET_KEY
- Basing on the image of the sample implementation, we copy the important functions to test the properties of matrix.

```python
import sys
import numpy as np

def sysout(fstr):
   sys.stdout.write(fstr)
   sys.stdout.flush()

def vectostr(v):
   return "".join(map(str,v.reshape(-1)))

def strtovec(s, rows=8, cols=1):
   return np.fromiter(list(s),dtype="int").reshape(rows,cols)

SECRET_KEY = np.round(np.random.rand(8,8)).astype("int")

if __name__ == "__main__":
   print(SECRET_KEY)
   
   print("Challenge Me")
   for i in range(8):
      input_vec = input(f"Challenge Me #{i} <-- ")
      assert len(input_vec) == 8
      assert input_vec.count("1") + input_vec.count("0") == 8
      input_vec = strtovec(input_vec)
      #print(input_vec) 
      output_vec = (SECRET_KEY @ input_vec)
      sysout(f"My Response --> {vectostr(output_vec)}\n")
      output_vec = (SECRET_KEY @ input_vec)&1
      sysout(f"My Response --> {vectostr(output_vec)}\n")
```

#### Sending Payload Challenges

![[Pasted image 20220829181142.png]]

```
1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0

1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1

```

![[Pasted image 20220829181215.png]]

```python
import sys
import numpy as np

def sysout(fstr):
   sys.stdout.write(fstr)
   sys.stdout.flush()

def vectostr(v):
   return "".join(map(str,v.reshape(-1)))

def strtovec(s, rows=8, cols=1):
   return np.fromiter(list(s),dtype="int").reshape(rows,cols)

SECRET_KEY = np.matrix('1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1;1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0;1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1;0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0;0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1;1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0;1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1;0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1')
   
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print(SECRET_KEY)
   input2 = input(f"Challenge <-- ")
   input2 = strtovec(input2)
#   output = (SECRET_KEY@input2)
#   sysout(f"Answer --> {vectostr(output)}\n")
   output = (SECRET_KEY@input2)&1
   sysout(f"Answer --> {vectostr(output)}\n")
```

## Level 3 : Patient0 - Part 1
Palindrome has spread some virus to corrupt machines causing incorrect readings in patients' health measurements and rending them unusable. Inspect the file and see if you can uncover the 8 corrupted bytes that renders the file system unusable? 

#### Recon
- Using File we realise that this file is a NTFS drive.

![[Pasted image 20220829193859.png]]

- We first repair drive with test disk.

```
testdisk PATIENT0
```

- Then we compare the unrepaired file with the repaired file.

```
xxd PATIENT0 > PATIENT0.hex
xxd PATIENT0_repaired > PATIENT0_repaired.hex
diff PATIENT0.hex PATIENT0_repaired.hex
```

![[Pasted image 20220830003212.png]]

- We can tell that the 8 continuous bytes that was changed was `f766 35ab` therefore the flag for this challenge is `TISC{f76635ab}`.

## Level 3 : PATIENT 0 - Part 2 
Palindrome must have leaked one of their passwords as the 4 corrupted bytes (Part 1 flag)! Dig deeper to find what was hidden! 

### Hints
![[Pasted image 20220830005958.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220830010014.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220830010030.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220830201738.png]]

### Recon
- In the Recon stage, we look around the repaired file systems for clues as stated in the hints and the following clues were found : [[#message png]], [[#message png ADS]], [[#broken pdf]].

#### message.png
![[Pasted image 20220830010622.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220830010558.png]]

#### message.png ADS
![[Pasted image 20220830013120.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220830015328.png]]

#### broken.pdf
![[Pasted image 20220830011441.png]]

### Unlocking Outer
- Taking the ADS `$RAND` we removed the clue strings with hex editors and proceeded to mount the file with TrueCrypt (derived from the clue and hints) and used the flag for [[#Level 3 Patient0 - Part 1]] as password.

![[Pasted image 20220830021155.png]]

- The mounting was successful as can be seen above and we see an image file below.

![[Pasted image 20220830021044.png]]

- Following this [link](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-5861.html) and the below comment : 

![[Pasted image 20220830203643.png]]

- Following the instructions above we get the following : 

![[Pasted image 20220830204744.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220830203020.png]]

- As can be seen, there is a hash collision that resembles what clue 4 has given : `c01lis1on`. With this as password, we managed to unlock the hidden compartment of the encrypted volume,

![[Pasted image 20220830203210.png]]

- There is a `flag.ppsm` file (macro-enabled powerpoint) and it corresponds with the `PK` header which stands for ZIP or compressed format - Powerpoint files are a kind of zipped files.

![[Pasted image 20220830203231.png]]

- Using 7zip, we unzipped the ppsm file and we checked Media to see if there is any media within the powerpoint.

![[Pasted image 20220830203411.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220830203509.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220830203454.png]]

- We opened one of the images and it says to get a `MD5` hash of the sound clip to get the flag. 

![[Pasted image 20220830203434.png]]

- We get the hash of the sound clip with certutil and the result is below : 

![[Pasted image 20220830204043.png]]

```
Flag : TISC{f9fc54d767edc937fc24f7827bf91cfe}
```
