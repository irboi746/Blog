# Chapter 0
>Disclaimer : There is no such chapter in the actual Practical Malware Analysis book.

- In the midst of working with a few malware samples, I realised that some of them have similar code structure, functions and imports despite difference in hash.
- The purpose of this chapter is to prevent double work for malware analysis. 
- Whilst I understand the reason for using the same malware (lesson objectives) I am using the malware in this book as samples to practice on, build an analysis workflow and gain confidence hence the need to not do double work.
- This will also has the added benefit of teaching how to identify variants of the same malware or when polymorphism techniques are used.
 
## SSDEEP
- A quick and dirty method employed here will be to use this tool SSDEEP which is a fuzzy hashing tool. 
- While there are other techniques used like ImpHash and section hash, SSDEEP is the only tool known to me that can do it at scale and automatically.

   ```
   ssdeep -d -r -c ./Folder_with_malware
   ```
